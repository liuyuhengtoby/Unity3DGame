# Unity3DGame
A 3D third-person RPG game demo

Due to large file size, the original file is not uploaded, the executable can be found on my itch:

## Some features in the game:
1. orignal terrain created
2. player and enemy movement auto-navigation
3. player and enemy animation for hit, run and death
4. player level-up system and a mini task system
5. player and enemy UI
6. abstracted player and enemy stats tracked using scriptable objects for easy changes

This is a 3-week school project done in pairwork
